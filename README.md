# Email Mass Sender

A web application for sending mass emails using multiple Gmail accounts to overcome Google's sending limits.

## Overview

Email Mass Sender allows users to send up to 10,000 emails per day by distributing the load across multiple Gmail accounts. The system automatically manages the distribution of emails to stay within Google's limit of 2,000 emails per day per account.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Gmail Account Support**: Connect and manage multiple sender accounts
- **Mass Email Campaigns**: Send HTML emails to thousands of recipients
- **Automatic Distribution**: Smart distribution of emails across sender accounts
- **HTML Email Editor**: Create and preview HTML email templates
- **CSV Import**: Import recipient lists via CSV files
- **Campaign Monitoring**: Track sending progress and status
- **User Management**: Admin interface for managing system users

## Architecture

This project is built as a monorepo using Nx with three main components:

1. **Web App**: React + Tailwind CSS frontend
2. **API Service**: NestJS REST API backend
3. **Worker Service**: NestJS worker processes for handling email sending

The system uses Redis for job queuing and PostgreSQL for data storage.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/npm-workspaces-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
